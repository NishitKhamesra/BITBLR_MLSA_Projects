The problem we are trying to solve is the inefficiency and lack of sustainability in traditional job search and task management processes. Many individuals and businesses often struggle to find suitable professionals or service providers for their specific needs, resulting in wasted time, resources, and increased environmental impact. Additionally, there is a growing need to incorporate AI assistants and technologies that can perform tasks more efficiently, reducing human labor and potential environmental harm.

Our web app aims to address these challenges by acting as a consultant and facilitating the process of finding the right people for a job while also offering AI assistants as alternative options. By doing so, we hope to streamline task management, improve efficiency, and promote sustainability by reducing unnecessary resource consumption and optimizing the utilization of available talent and technology.

### Does your team have any experience to implement this idea on-ground?

Our team has been actively working on developing and testing the concept of our web app. While we have conducted preliminary testing with known managers, we acknowledge that large-scale testing with hiring potential is still pending.

However, despite the pending large-scale testing, our team possesses relevant experience and expertise in web app development, artificial intelligence, and sustainability. We have a strong understanding of the technical requirements and challenges involved in implementing such a solution. Our collective knowledge and skills allow us to approach the project with confidence and the ability to address potential hurdles.

To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution, we plan to conduct extensive testing and validation as we move forward. This will involve collaborating with potential users, seeking feedback, and continuously refining the web app to meet the specific needs and requirements of employers and job seekers.

While we acknowledge that large-scale testing is crucial to validate the solution's performance, our team's experience and dedication put us in a strong position to implement the idea effectively and iteratively improve upon it based on user feedback and real-world usage.
